# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

This eval is taken from [ADBench][], although it is not discussed in the ADBench paper. LSTM is a kind of recurrent neural network architecture popular (at least at one point) in named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging. The ADBench variant has a quirk in that all the weight matrices are diagonal. [ADBench seemed to have a plan to eventually rename the LSTM benchmark][rename], but never got around to it. For consistency with ADBench, we have maintained the name.

## Protocol

The protocol is specified in terms of [TypeScript][] types and references [types defined in the GradBench protocol description][protocol].

### Inputs

The eval sends a leading `DefineMessage` followed by `EvaluateMessages`. The `input` field of any `EvaluateMessage` will be an instance of the `LSTMInput` type defined below. The `function` field will be either the string `"objective"` or `"jacobian"`.

```typescript
interface LSTMInput extends Runs {
  main_params: double[][];
  extra_params: double[][];
  state: double[][];
  sequence: double[][];
}
```

### Outputs

A tool must respond to an `EvaluateMessage` with an `EvaluateResponse`. The type of the `output` field in the `EvaluateResponse` depends on the `function` field in the `EvaluateMessage`:

- `"objective"`: `LSTMObjectiveOutput`.
- `"jacobian"`: `LSTMJacobianOutput`.

```typescript
type LSTMObjectiveOutput = double;
type LSTMJacobianOutput = double[];
```

The `LSTMJacobianOutput` is the gradient of `main_params` and `extra_params`, flattened such that rows are adjacent ("column major order"), and concatenated.

Because the input extends `Runs`, the tool is expected to run the function some number of times. It should include one timing entry with the name `"evaluate"` for each time it ran the function.

## Commentary

This eval is similar to [gmm][] in that it asks for the gradient of a
scalar-valued function, and is thus suited for reverse mode. The main
additional challenge is that `lstm` also contains a sequential loop,
which will require an AD tool to handle the taping/tracing
efficiently. An even simpler eval with the same properties is [ode][],
which you might consider implementing first.
