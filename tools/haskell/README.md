# Haskell

[Haskell][] is a lazy purely functional language, with AD support
provided by the [`ad`][] package.

To run this outside Docker, you need to install `ghc` and `cabal`. You
are advised to `cabal build` it before using `cabal run` to run it
(see the command in the Dockerfile), as otherwise the build output
from `cabal` will interfere with the protocol.

## Running outside of Docker

You need a Haskell development environment, including `cabal` and
`ghc`. The easiest way to get one is to use [ghcup][] or
[shell.nix][].

Then run the following command to populate local knowledge of the
Hackage package repository:

```
$ cabal update
```

Use this command to compile the tool:

```
$ cabal build --project-dir tools/haskell gradbench
```

And finally this command to run it:

```
$ cabal run --project-dir tools/haskell gradbench
```

The `cabal run` command will actually compile if necessary as well,
but its diagnostic output can interfere with the protocol when used as
the `--tool` argument to `gradbench`.
