# OCaml

OCaml is a functional language with an algebraic effect system that
can be used to implement automatic differentiation. The code here was
originally written by [Jesse Sigal][] and integrated into ADBench as
part of his research. The [original code][] is still available. The
parts that are specific to ADBench integration have been removed and
replaced with GradBench-specific code.
