# An ODE Solution

This benchmark is adapted from the `an_ode` benchmark from [cmpad][],
for which the [original documentation][] is also available.

The problem is to approximately solve an ODE of form

```math
\begin{array}{llll}
y_i '(t) & = & x_0                          & \mbox{for} \; i = 0 \\
y_i '(t) & = & \sum_{j=1}^i x_j y_{i-1} (t) & \mbox{for} \; i > 0  \\
\end{array}
```

with initial value

```math
y_i (0) = 0  \; \mbox{for all} \; i
```

using Runge-Kutta with $s$ steps.

The differentiated problem is to compute the gradient of the last
element of the primal output, relative to all inputs. That is, both
the primal function and the differentiated function accept a vector of
$n$ elements and produce a vector of $n$ elements (in addition to a
parameter $s$, which is not differentiable).

## Protocol

The evaluation protocol is specified in terms of [TypeScript][] types
and references [types defined in the GradBench protocol
description][protocol].

### Inputs

The eval sends a leading `DefineMessage` followed by
`EvaluateMessages`. The `input` field of any `EvaluateMessage` will be
an instance of the `ODEInput` type defined below. The `function` field
will one of the strings `"primal"` or `"gradient"`.

```typescript
interface ODEInput extends Runs {
  x: double[];
  s: int;
}
```

Because the input extends `Runs`, the tool is expected to run the
function some number of times. It should include one timing entry with
the name `"evaluate"` for each time it ran the function.

### Outputs

A tool must respond to an `EvaluateMessage` with an
`EvaluateResponse`. The type of the `output` field in the
`EvaluateResponse` is in both cases a vector of the same size as `x`:

```typescript
type PrimalOutput = double[];
type GradientOutput = double[];
```

## Commentary

This eval is best implemented with reverse mode, and the main
challenge for this eval is the sequential loop with $s$ steps, which
requires the AD tool to maintain a tape. The [lstm][] eval is a more
complicated problem that exercises roughly the same parts of AD.
