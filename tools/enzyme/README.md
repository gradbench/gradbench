# Manual

[Enzyme][] is a tool for computing derivatives of arbitrary LLVM IR code. The implementations here use the sequential objective functions implemented in C++ and differentiated with Enzyme, through an LLVM plugin.

Enzyme needs to be compiled against a specific version of LLVM. You are strongly advised to use the Dockerfile for this one.
