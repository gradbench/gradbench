# Charged particle trajectory

The benchmark models a charged particle accelerated by an electric
field formed by a pair of repulsive bodies, with the goal being to
find a control parameter that causes the movement of the particle to
intersect the origin. This benchmark, along with [saddle](../saddle/),
was originally proposed by Pearlmutter and Siskind in the papers
[Using Programming Language Theory to Make Automatic Differentiation
Sound and
Efficient](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-68942-3_8)
and [Putting the Automatic Back into AD: Part I, Whatâ€™s
Wrong](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/ecetr/368/).

## Specification

A particle is modeled by position $\mathbf{x}(t)$ and velocity
$\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t)$ where $t$ is the time, and the acceleration is
given by

```math
p(\mathbf{x};w) = \Vert\mathbf{x}-(10,10-w)\Vert^{-1} + \Vert\mathbf{x}-(10,0)\Vert^{-1}
```

where $w$ is a control parameter that we can adjust. The particle hits
the $x$-axis at position $\mathbf{x}(t_f)$. We desire to compute

```math
\text{min}_w\ x_0(t_f)^2
```

which makes the particle intersect the origin (this is an *argmin*
operation).

[Naive Euler ODE integration][] is used to compute the particle's
path, with linear interpolation to find the intersection with the $x$
axis (see paper for the formula, or the code for one of the existing
tools, this is not expressible with GitHub's math support). This ODE
to find $x_0(t_f)^2$ involves taking the gradient of the $p$ function
defined above. The *argmin* operation is solved with gradient descent.
Thus, we have an instance of nested AD.

The benchmark can be implemented in four function variants, which at
the GradBench level exist as four functions. They differ in which mode
of AD is used for step 1 above:

* `ff`, where the argmin uses forward mode and the Euler method uses forward mode.
* `fr`, where the argmin uses forward mode and the Euler method uses reverse mode.
* `rf`, where the argmin uses reverse mode and the Euler method uses forward mode.
* `rr`, where the argmin uses reverse mode and the Euler method uses reverse mode.

All function variants accept the same input and must produce the same
results.

## Protocol

The evaluation protocol is specified in terms of [TypeScript][] types
and references [types defined in the GradBench protocol
description][protocol].

### Inputs

The eval sends a leading `DefineMessage` with a module named `saddle`,
followed by `EvaluateMessages`. The `input` field of any
`EvaluateMessage` will be an instance of the `SaddleInput` type
defined below. The `function` field will one of the strings `"ff"`,
`"fr"`, `"rr"`, `"rf"`, which all have the same input/output
interface.

```typescript
interface SaddleInput extends Runs {
  w: double;
}
```

This is the starting point for computing $w$.

### Outputs

A tool must respond to an `EvaluateMessage` with an
`EvaluateResponse`. The type of the `output` field in the
`EvaluateResponse` must be `SaddleOutput`.

```typescript
type SaddleOutput = double;
```

The output is the final value of $w$.
